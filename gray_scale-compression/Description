Write an efficient algorithm for the following purpose. Suppose you are given a small grayscale image. If the gray values in adjacent pixels differ by a max of 1, then treat those values as almost equal and consider their average as the resultant gray value for those pixels. Compress the data set using the above approach and then reconstruct the image from the compressed data. Do the necessary experimentation and analysis with your algorithm.
